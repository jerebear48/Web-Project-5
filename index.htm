        My name is Jeremy Rudolph, i grew up in a small town in rural Nova Scotia with a population of around 200 people. 
        My father took an IT course back in the 80s/90s so growing up ive always had a home computer.
        My father would let me go on it and game and use the web with supervision, back then we had dial up with windows 98, 
        and thats how my love for technology began, hence why i decided to pursue a career in IT.
